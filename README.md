# siamese_on_edge_divided_inference

This repository is similar to the improved_siamese one, with some additional code refactoring.
Working Tensorflow version is 1.12.0. The code is divided into training and testing. Testing performs additional time
 computations for 1-way branch vs trunk segments in a siamese network.
